# go-interview-problems

I created this repository in 2021 to learn Go and practice common, intriguing, and challenging interview problems.

I selected most of the problems from LeetCode based on their popularity and interview frequency at companies like Google, Amazon, Apple, and Microsoft.

The repository is organized in directoriess based on subject matter.
